# PhillyScript

_The programming language you never knew you didn't need._

This is an experimental programming language that takes a novel approach to
many types of operations while remaining iconically Philadelphia.

It is a superset of the Typescript programming language, which is in itself a
superset of the Javascript programming language. As such, this is really an
example of transpilers calling transpilers.

Note: Do not use this in actual applications.

Why did I create this project? Mainly as a way to experiment with different
types of language semantics and features. I don't plan on maintaining it.

## Quickstart

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
1. Run `yarn build` to build the transpiler
1. Run `yarn demo` to execute the transpiler

This runs the `pst` transpiler tool on `demo.phl`, the demo file.

See LANG.md for a deeper description of language features.
